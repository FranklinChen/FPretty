# FPretty

My own fork of [FPretty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/FPretty) because I
cannot reach the maintainers in order to have my changes accepted to
support GHC 8.4 and beyond.

I started with downloading the source code at https://hackage.haskell.org/package/FPretty-1.1/FPretty-1.1.tar.gz and modifying that.
